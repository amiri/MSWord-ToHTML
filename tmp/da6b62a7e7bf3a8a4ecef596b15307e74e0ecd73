<p class="Normal-P">John Garvey</p>
<p class="Normal-P">It was recently reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the US Department of Labor that, in 2009, the union
membership rate—the percent of wage and salary workers who were
members of a union—was 12.3 percent, essentially unchanged from
12.4 percent a year earlier,</p>
<p class="Normal-P">However, the number of wage and salary workers
belonging to unions declined by 771,000 to 15.3 million, largely
reflecting the overall drop in employment due to the crisis. In
1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available,
the union membership rate was 20.1 percent, and there were 17.7
million union workers. Nothing so surprising so far! A combination
of employer assaults on unions and a deep-seated conviction on the
part of many workers that unions seldom represented anything other
than the interests of those who run them had all but inevitably
contributed to a steady erosion in the ranks of union members.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">Of perhaps greater interest was the finding
that, for the first time, more public sector employees (7.9
million) belonged to a union than did private sector employees (7.4
million), despite there being five times more wage and salary
workers in the private sector. As a result, the union membership
rate for public sector workers (37.4%) was much higher than the
rate for private industry workers (7.2%). Workers in education,
training, and library occupations had the highest unionization rate
at 38.1 percent. Close behind were protective service workers at
35.6%. Protective service workers include police, jail and prison
guards.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">In this essay, I’d like to explore some of the
consequences of the long-term decline in union membership and the
significant shift in membership towards public sector workers.
First off, I’d like to highlight the trend in enrollments in
postsecondary institutions over the course of the last forty years.
According to the Digest of Education Statistics, total enrollments
in postsecondary degree granting institutions (including both
public and private, community colleges, baccalaureate colleges and
graduate schools) were as follows:</p>

<p class="Normal-P">All told, the increase over the forty year
period amounted to over ten million individuals or 117%. Much of
this extraordinary growth was fueled by the federal government’s
financial aid policies—including Pell Grants and subsidized student
loans. Interestingly enough, the Pell Grant program has now become
a major source of revenue for the fast-growing proprietary sector.
Those colleges enroll about 6% of all college students but account
for 20% of all Pell grant awards. They currently are fifteen of the
twenty institutions receiving the most federal funds through the
grant program. In 2008-2009, the University of Phoenix received
$658.9 million. But this essay is not about the need to reform the
Pell Grant program.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">What is most remarkable is that the continued
growth in enrollment has occurred in spite of the fact that many
individuals who enroll in college, especially community colleges,
never earn a college degree. At the City University of New York
(CUNY), just about 50% of students enrolled in baccalaureate
programs earn a degree in six years but less than 30% do so at the
associate degree level. These figures don’t differ significantly
from the national picture. Only about 52 percent of college
students complete a degree, and very few do so within four
years.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do people keep
enrolling? I suggest that it is not unrelated to what has
accompanied the long-term decline in union membership over the past
several decades—de-industrialization and casualization—meaning the
increased number of workers who are employed part-time, perhaps
haphazardly, and all but certainly without security or benefits. In
the face of the steady disappearance of collective means for the
defense and/or advance of workers’ interests, lots of individual
workers found themselves with little alternative to trying to make
the best of things for themselves by attending school and hoping to
earn a credential that would perhaps give them what they couldn’t
find—a job that might be worth it.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">But they’re not finding it in college either.
Two authors have recently described the world of community college
students—Mark Bosquet, in How the University Works: Higher
Education in the Low-Wage Nation, concludes that most community
college students are already workers and that the jobs they have
make it all but impossible for them to be reasonably successful at
being students—he has an especially harrowing description of
students employed by UPS in Louisville. Rebecca Cox, in The College
Fear Factor, describes how students are haunted by a desperate hope
that they’ll be able to find something better through completing a
degree. But, their desperation drives all too many of them to poor
choices about which programs to enroll in and how to become
successful students. For the most part, unlike membership in a
union (even a rotten, lousy one), education is seen as an
individual strategy. When it doesn’t work, the responsibility for
failure or defeat is the individual’s—“I didn’t study enough; I
picked the wrong major; I guess I’m not cut out for school. Maybe I
deserve to be where I’m stuck.” To make matters worse, many unions
(especially those in the health care fields) have increasingly
encouraged their members to seek advancement and improvements in
wages through participation in education and training programs.
Front and center of this trend has been Local 1199 of SEIU, the
health care workers union in New York City. Ariel Ducey, in Never
Good Enough: Health Care Workers and the False Promise of Job
Training, has captured the outcomes—little advancement, few
improvements in wages and lots of bitterness among frustrated
workers. But the bitterness is all too often accompanied by
resignation—especially in a self-proclaimed and endlessly promoted
“progressive” union like 1199.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">Let’s turn now to the significance of the trend
towards higher unionization rates in the public sector. This growth
has not been the result of a higher level of militance or strike
activity. Indeed, there are numerous restrictions on the right of
public sector workers to strike. In New York State, the Taylor Law,
approved after the 1966 transit workers’ strike in NYC, imposes
fines on unions and jail-time for union leaders if workers strike.
Federal workers are not even allowed to be in unions that advocate
strikes--Reagan had no trouble in firing the PATCO air controllers.
As a result, public sector unions are heavily dependent on
cultivating the good will and friendship of various political
leaders—thus, they invest heavily in political campaigns and in
lobbying on both sides of the two party aisle. Recently, a veteran
United Federation of Teachers (UFT—the union that represents public
school teachers in New York City) member and union staffer wrote an
essay arguing for political realism in the current round of
collective bargaining between the union and the city. To do so, he
recalled the aftermath of a teacher strike in 1968:</p>
<p class="Normal-P">In November of 1968, after a brutal forty day
strike teachers stumbled back to school, the dailies, the liberal
intelligentsia flayed teachers and their union and the impact of
the strike resonates forty years later. To make matters worse, the
contract was ending, it looked as if another war was brewing with
Mayor John Lindsay. A year later with the negotiations concluded
the mayor and the union stood arm in arm as Governor Rockefeller
signed Tier I into law, a change in the pension that was so
dramatic as to boggle the mind. As they walked out of the
Governor’s Office the author of the plan Dave Wittes, the UFT
Secretary, leaned over and whispered to my wife, “They have no idea
what they have done…” ….Why did a mayor who had done everything in
his power to destroy the union agree to such a rich benefit? It was
simple, just plain old politics. John Lindsay wanted to be
President and he needed Al Shanker and his teachers.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal-P">He neglected to mention what the strike had
been about. Put simply, it was an effort by the union to defeat
efforts by the city’s black communities to achieve community
control of the schools after numerous earlier efforts at school
integration had failed in the face of white opposition. The strike
ended with a series of compromises—to the ultimate and profound
disadvantage of the students attending schools in black
communities. (See Jerold Podair’s The Strike That Changed New
York). But, as the staffer noted, it did wonders for the UFT.
Indeed, the book by Podair could have been titled The Strike That
Made the Union.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">In the years after 1968, several legislative
acts had reduced the rich benefits gained in 1968 for teachers who
joined the system afterwards—specifically by raising the retirement
age. In 2005, the same author quoted above was advising UFT members
looking to restore a lower retirement age:</p>
<p class="Normal-P">The NYS Constitution guarantees that pension
benefits for public employees may not be reduced. The legislature
can create new Tiers of the pension system for future employees.
Pension improvements, however, require the cooperation of the Mayor
and the support of the State legislature and the Governor. Members
who rail against our support of Republicans as well as Democrats
are shortsighted. One party does not pass legislation. If we can
take advantage of a political climate to create significant pension
improvements we should seize the moment.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal-P">It took the UFT until 2008 to secure the
victory it wanted but they did get it.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">I don’t want to pick on the UFT but there’s
another recent example of the ways in which public sector unions,
especially the larger ones with substantial dues revenues, can use
the regular political system to their advantage (specifically for
the increase of their dues revenues). While George Pataki was
Governor of New York, the state legislature passed a bill to allow
individuals who provided child care services in their homes to be
represented by a union. Pataki vetoed it but when he was replaced
by Eliot Spitzer, the same allowance was approved through an
Executive Order. In October of 2007, a representation election was
held and more than 8,000 of these home providers voted to be
represented by the UFT. As a result, the UFT secured the rights to
represent and collect dues from 28,000 providers in NYC. The Civil
Service Employees Association (CSEA) got to do the same for another
26,000 individuals elsewhere in the state. Then, in 2009, the UFT
and CSEA negotiated their first contracts with the New York State
Office of Children and Family Services for the newly organized
child care providers. So, to recap, the unions persuaded
legislators and a friendly governor to approve the right of the
providers to be represented; then, the same unions won the right to
represent those workers and finally negotiated a contract with a
state agency. And lest it be forgotten, underneath all this is
simple politics—money, votes and re-elections. Although the details
may vary across the country, I suggest that the pattern represented
in these stories goes a long way towards explaining why there are
now more union members in the public sector.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">But it doesn’t stop there. In another recent
development, the current governor of new York, David Patterson
announced plans to close the Moriah Shock Incarceration
Correctional Facility near Mineville in the Adirondacks Mountains
as part of his strategy to close the state’s budget gap. The
facility, which is a special facility designed to shock inmates out
of their criminal inclinations through a kind of intensive basic
training, is located upon the abandoned site of a Republic Steel
iron-ore mine. Currently, there are just over a hundred staff
members and fewer than 200 inmates. The people who work at Moriah
are represented by the Public Employees Federation (PEF), which has
thrown itself full force into a campaign to save the jobs. Their
argument is straightforward enough: “Moriah Shock Incarceration
Correctional Facility is a community,” said Richard Sheffer, a PEF
staffer, at a community rally. He went on: “Moriah embraced the
facility, as it did the mines, to provide employment for the
surrounding area.” From iron mines to iron bars!</p>
<p class="Normal-P">Which brings us to the last of the trends of
the last few decades—the trend towards incredibly high rates of
imprisonment and entanglement with the various parts of the
criminal justice system. Look at this graph!</p>

<p class="Normal-P">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal-P">All told, seven million adults are caught up in
this nightmare. And the union movement in upstate New York just
wants its small share and the jobs that go along with it. They want
to be “unionized: protective service workers. I wonder how many of
the inmates and how many of the correctional staff have ever been
members of a union not in the public sector and how many have
dropped out of community college. But, similar experiences aside,
it does matter which side of the bars you’re on.</p>
<p class="Normal-P">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the state of
affairs of working class struggle, or lack thereof, in the United
States in 2010.</p>
