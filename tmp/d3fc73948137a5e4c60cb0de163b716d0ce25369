<p class="style0-P">

cultural vitality of a community</p>

<p class="style0-P">My “Fresh Idea” for a better food system is
“rooted” in circumstances that are not so fresh at all.</p>
<p class="style0-P">The backdrop to the idea is another inner-city
community that has been systematically disfranchised and left
largely to fend for itself, the result being a type of community
blight―what I call human “blossom end rot” ( botanical term)―a slow
decay of human potential due to a lack of physical, mental and
emotional “nourishment.” Symptoms of the aforementioned “dis-ease”
are depravity, depression, despair and generational poverty cycles
that are seemingly impossible to break.</p>
<p class="style0-P">These symptoms are exacerbated in no small way
by the lack of access to adequate fresh and whole foods, and by the
lack of knowledge as to why and how to prepare these foods in a
culturally relevant, life-giving and life-sustaining way when they
are accessible.</p>
<p class="style0-P">The particular community that I live, work and
vision in―the West End Community of Birmingham, Alabama―has some of
the most alarming health statistics in the nation.</p>
<p class="style0-P">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obesity #</p>
<p class="style0-P">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes #</p>
<p class="style0-P">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart Disease #</p>
<p class="style0-P">Incidentally it is also ranked # for fast food
restaurants in the nation.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Although this particular community ranks in the
top 10 for health disparities across all major life-threatening
diseases, it is representative of the general state of low-income
communities of color across the nation.</p>
<p class="style0-P">The aforementioned health disparities are
largely (though not exclusively) the result of food practices that
diminish life energy and… life. These practices (diets high in the
consumption of processed, denatured and fatty foods, and low in the
consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables) are
encouraged by our present day fast lane/fast food culture and
enforced by circumstances in which the<br clear="all">
“healthy choice” is not the easy choice because all too often that
choice is not readily available.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Though the symptoms are complex the (dietary)
solutions are simple. Food is fundamental: fundamental to good
health, which is fundamental to strong bodies, which are
fundamental to strong minds. Strong minds create strong
communities. Strong communities are the foundation of a healthy
society, and a healthy society would naturally expect and support a
healthy food system.</p>
<p class="style0-P">I believe the way to a community's heart is
through its stomach. Once a community's heart is open, the stage is
set to share information, resources and “Fresh Ideas.” It is my
vision to revitalize a community's lifeblood, body, mind and spirit
through the collective process of growing good food, and by
creating educational and economically sustainable food institutions
that function in service of the health and well being of its
residents.</p>
<p class="style0-P">My “Fresh Idea” is rooted in reworking the old
adage of “teaching a man to fish”: it is about teaching a community
how to grow, and the notion that by changing a community's food
practices one person at a time, one bite at a time, you can change
a “system” community by community.</p>
<p class="style0-P">The foundations of such a vision are
Inspiration, Education and Institutions. </p>
<p class="style0-P">Inspiration through the fundamental example of
“Community Gardens” that are Beautiful and Bountiful. Beauty is
inspiring, and beautiful spaces interwoven into the fabric of
community give residents a place and a space to be. The gardens
would serve as multipurpose resources: creating green space, food
access, a safe place for seniors and young children to move; they
would provide specialized training for young people in horticulture
and green jobs relevant to agriculture.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Education through the implementation of
community-based classes, programs and events around healthy foods
appropriate to the community's culture. The objective of these
classes, programs and events would be to facilitate dialogue about
food and food choices and to experience culturally relevant foods
prepared in a whole and healthy way.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Institutions through the creation of holistic
models of food institutions that not only employ and profit
community members financially but provide social culture for mental
and emotional health. The net worth of these business institutions
is ultimately determined by their contribution to the health and
well being of the community in which they serve.</p>
<p class="style0-P">This is an evolutionary foundational structure
that can be replicated in other inner city neighborhoods,
reclaiming abandoned or neglected land and employing local youth at
a fair living wage. This workforce can be trained to run
sustainable food enterprises that help the community, and because
it is their community they will naturally have a vested interest in
the enterprise's stability, “growth” and success.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Local and state policy changes and new
initiatives are crucial components to enterprises based on the
acquisition and use of land for agriculture and agricultural
businesses in urban settings. A part of the process of initiating
policy changes for land use (vacant lots and city properties) and
for usage of city services (water and public works departments) is
to “cultivate” understanding, relationships and partnerships among
citizens, policymakers and politicians to encourage working in a
mutually beneficial and nonantagonistic manner to support food
enterprises that make a community a worthwhile place to live and a
city worthy of mention. Ultimately this can alleviate some of the
societal dysfunction and improve health conditions that burden not
only communities but local and state governments.</p>
<p class="style0-P">Is this a simplistic view? “Change the Food
System, Change the World”? Absolutely!</p>
<p class="style0-P">If a community's mind is changed about food, a
community changes the way it eats; if communities change the way
they eat, a system is changed.</p>
<p class="style0-P">There is an African proverb that questions: How
do you eat an elephant? Answer: One bite at a time.</p>
<p class="style0-P">My proverbial “Fresh Idea” is that communities
are just bites of the elephant. Communities make up cities, cities
make up states, states make nations and our national Food System,
though broken, can be Restored, Renewed and Transformed, one ‘bite’
at a time.</p>
