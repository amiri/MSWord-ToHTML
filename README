NAME
    MSWord::ToHTML5

    Take old or new format Word files and spit out HTML5.

NOTICE
    Because of the PITA involved in processing Word files, I have punted
    most of the work to Abiword <http://www.abisource.com/> and tidy
    <http://tidy.sourceforge.net/>.

    Which means that you must have the binary programs tidy and abiword
    installed.

SYNOPSIS
        {
            package My::Word::Converter;

            use strict;
            use warnings;
            use MSWord::ToHTML5;

            my $converter = MSWord::ToHTML5->new;
            my $doc = $converter->validate_file("/home/myself/my_excellent_writing.doc");
              # This returns an instance of MSWord::ToHTML5::Doc
            my $docx = $converter->validate_file("/home/myself/my_excellent_notes.docx");
              # This returns an instance of MSWord::ToHTML5::DocX

            my $writing_html = $doc->get_html;
            my $notes_html = $docx->get_html;

        }

    Those final two method calls return IO::All::File objects from files
    written to your temp directory. I haven't tested this on Windows, but
    the module attempts to be agnostic with regards to temporary
    directories.

METHODS
    new (constructor)
        MSWord::ToHTML5 is a Moose class, so new is Moose's constructor.

    validate_file
        This gets you the only thing you need, which is an object ready to
        give you its HTML.

    get_html
        This is the other important method, that gives you an IO::All::File
        object with your fresh HTML5 doc.
